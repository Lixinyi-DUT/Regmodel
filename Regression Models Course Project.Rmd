This is a document on regression models course project(<https://github.com/rdpeng/courses/tree/master/07_RegressionModels/project>), which will focus on the problem about the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG).



```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
